Create an application where visitors save fragments of text.
In addition to the addition part, each user can see a list of all texts already saved in the application. If the text is too long to display in the list, only the first few letters of the text will be displayed.
To see the full text, the user will click on an item in the list and will be redirected to a page where only that text will be displayed.
